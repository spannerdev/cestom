## Usage

### Configuration
Edit configuration in `cestom.properties`. This file will automatically be created in the working directory if it doesn't already exist.
```properties
# host address to listen on; beware of using "localhost" if behind docker
server.listen.host=0.0.0.0
# port to listen on
server.listen.port=25565
# mode any of { OFFLINE, ONLINE, BUNGEECORD, VELOCITY }
server.mode=ONLINE
# tickspeed to run at in ticks per second
server.tps=20
# distance that chunks will be sent to the client (in chunks)
server.view_distance.chunk=8
# distance that entities will be sent to the client (in chunks)
server.view_distance.entity=5
# secret for servers behind velocity
velocity.secret=""
```

### Commands
- #### `stop`  
  Aliases: `shutdown`  
  Permissions: `cestom.stop`  
  Description: Stops the server. Can be run at any time from the terminal, or through a player with matching permissions.

### Logging
Logging works in the same way as in the original Minestom. Get the logger from `MinecraftServer.LOGGER`. Supports `Component`s via Minestom's ANSI converter.

### Extensions
Extensions work exactly the same way as the original implementation. See [the Minestom wiki](https://wiki.minestom.net/expansion/extensions).
